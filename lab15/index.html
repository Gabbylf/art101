					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab's challenge was to be able to confidently use AJAX to link and show different APIs on our websites. As a sort of way to link other websites and images onto our own without having to leave it.</p>

			    <div id="problem" class="special">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I only had a few very minor problems arise, the only major being some faulty names as I didn't understand when looking at examples that I needed data.answers and not linking it to what I named the function instead. Though with testing, I understand that that was it's own function and not that of hich I could name what i had as my own function down. Besides that, it was just some spelling mistakes.</p>
			    </div>

			    <div id="reflection" class="special">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like I didn't fully understand the function as I did have to rely on the examples more than I generally do for this assignment. I think it's because there were a few more new oens that usual such as the data.answers and such that I wasn't fully understanding. Though with working through it and with the examples, I ddi get a better understanding of it but feel like I do also still need more practice. </p>
