		<h1> The Subject of Lab 3</h1>
		<p> We believe the subject of lab 3 was to be able to effectively sort through our files between addings screenshots as well as functioning links. There was also some light work with fixing up photos as well as touching up our ever growing webpage that we have been working on since lab 1. Not only that but to also work on our continuing skills in teambuilding and teamwork, as we did meet up to make sure we both understood what to do and how to get started for this assignment. That is what we believe was the subject of this current lab.</p>
		<h1> The Difficulties of Lab 3</h1>
		<p> We wanted to make sure we both understood what to do for Lab 3 so we chose to meet up to go over it. However there were some difficulties with setting up times due to our conflicting schedules and such short notice but we were able to settle. The major error we ran into was actually due to problematic image files that we couldn't get just right. We ended up just taking screenshots and sharing them among each other just so we can program them into our code through discord. Besides that, there wasn't any other difficulties we encountered as we worked fairly well together to make sure we can overcome said difficulties.</p>
		<h1> The Results!</h1>
		<p> We hope the results of our efforts speak for themselves between the index.html back in art101 as well as the results for lb's index.html. So here's the image of the code we both figured out how to use down below!</p>
		<h1> art101's index.html's code</h1>
