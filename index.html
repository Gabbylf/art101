					<p>I am defintely more of an artist than I am a coder. I took way too long trying to get this set up. I think I downloaded and uploaded the wrong file somehow cause I got some weird lab template that was definetely not this. Deleted and reuploaded to get hub and it seemed to have fixed it. Anyway I also play a lot of video games, enjoy some Final Fantasy XIV or some Sun Haven if you like more indie. Have some stickers that I drew and have on my laptop! Nevermind, the image is png and I'm too lazy to send it as a jpg... Why are all my photos png? There, my current wallpaper!</p>
