					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> Name: Gabriella Frint</p>
					<p> Nickname: Gabby</p>
					<p> Student of UCSC's Art Deparment</p>
					<p> Age: 21</p>
					<p> Prounouns: She/Her</p>

					<p>Hello, I am Gabriella Frint and I attend UCSC as a junior in college. My major is arts however I was briefly interested in computer programming back in my freshman year. However upong trying to learn python, I decided it would be for the best to shift my focus back to doing something I much prefered.</p>
					<p>A bit about myself was that I grew up in a military family so as you'd expect, I lived in more than my fair share of states. I was born in Hawaii however we moved before I could even remember anything about it. When we moved, we went to Texas where we lived for five years. Due to how Texas' education is set up, I actually didn't start school until we moved to Washington when I was six. Where I finally started school. Though we didn't stay in Washington long as we moved Virginia and lived there for a few years. Lastly and finally, we one last move from Virginia to California when my father retired from the military. And in California we stayed though have moved houses here or there after. </p>
					<p>Now about my art, I have been drawing since middle school during kind of a rough mental period. I used art as an escape where I drew things that I loved whether it was books, movies or video games. Now even though those days are long since behind me and my mental state have improve drastically, I still find myself drawing and wanting to improve. It's what if eel in love with and it's what gives me comfort.</p>
