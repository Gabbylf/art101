			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To Create a html page using aspects of css.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We solved our problems by properly splitting up the work to suit our skills and stayed in touch with each phase, asking questions to each toher when we need to and constant communication. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We ended up putting a lot of energy into the project, constantly looking at w3schools as a reference to figure out how to code things, learning how to change the size of a image and plenty of trial and error when it came to the css coding. There were constant time we had to go back and revise our css coding to make sure it looked as presentable as possible. Sometimes just throwing random things in to see how they turn out without fully knowing and editing from there. That was actually quite enjoyable to do, never knew what was going to happen until it did. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Our results showed that while we are both lacking in experinece computer programming, we can try our best to make a functioning project together as simple as it might've turned out.</p>
