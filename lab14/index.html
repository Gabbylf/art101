					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This assignment's challenge was to go back to older labs where something may have happened during the coding and then proceed to debug it. Making it work as intended now that we know more about how to code. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> It was quite amusing that problems I had before were now very easy to fix. As I had absolutely no problems moving forward with my lab 4's css. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Sometime's it's the smallest error that absolutely stumps you for some time. It could simply be a wrong file direction when linking something like mine was. My css wasn't linked correctly due to a difference between lab.css and index.css. Though being able to figure it out as quickly as I did does show improvement in coding, at least in my opinion.</p>

					<p> I was always wondering why my css never worked, I tried so many placements and rewriting the line of code trying to get it to link. I think after so many times, i just decided to just turn it in as is. I knew when this assigment came up, I immediately knew I was going to go take a look back at my lab 4 css to try and finally get it to work. As I was looking through, I quickly found the issue that I was having. My css was named differently then what I normally had it, so when it was looing for index.css, it wasn't finding anything at all. Meanwhile, the css for lab 4 was instead called lab.css so causing the error to not find the css fike. A quick and simple swap, I just changed the code instead of the css name, manage to finally get that css working on my lab 4 webpage.</p>
