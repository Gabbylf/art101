			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge I had to do was to assign an array and the proceed to use that array but then adding anon functions to it to multiply it and even divide it later on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My main problem was that I was rather busy with other obligations over the weekend to the point where I was worried I was going to be dragging someone else down due to my lack of time. So i instead decided to lose the extra point for partnership in order to make sure I don't do as such.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think by doing this assignment, what console.log really was finally and completely clicked, as I had some confusion in the past before doing this assignment. As I try to add it to figure out what it did only to see nothing come up. This was the assignment where it fully clicked and I could use it effectively as to what was being asked of me.</p>
