					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Our challenge was to use multiple functions of both html, a button as well as multiple functions of js, including, well, functions, retrieving things and combining them with plder elements from lab 7.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My only problem was getting rid of the null error in the beginning as it would not go away no matter how much I tried. Though with some trial and error, we ended up looking at Modes' website for help where, with even more trial and error, found the solution to the issues. Getting rid of the null error and sorting some things out further as we learned from the website. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I do wish I was able to fully understand what to dow ithout having to rely on other things. However by using other things, like each other and the the website, I was fully able to understand what to do as there were clear examples. Going through line per line to see what i ddi differently does help get a better understand on not just what other's did but your own work as well.</p>
